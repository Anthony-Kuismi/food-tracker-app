## Project Technologies
This project uses the API [CalorieNinjas](https://calorieninjas.com/). (Key Removed)

In addition, the project uses Firestore through [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to store user data. The project uses the `firebase_core` and `cloud_firestore` packages. (Inactive Database)

> **Note:** The project was running in test mode. This means that the Firestore database is not secure and should be changed in the future if the project would be made public.

The project uses Flutter 78.02 and Dart 3.2.5.
